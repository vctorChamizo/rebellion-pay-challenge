# Rebellion Test Backender

Hola Rebel! This is the test. Good luck!

## Description

We would like to start to use Cloudinary to save some public photos, but we are afraid about the use some people could do of this platform.

We need a Microservice with 2 calls made with Node.js.

This application is going to run into a cluster so it could be good dockerize the application.

### Get some statistics

Sample URL: SOME_URL/cloudinary/statistics

Showing the info (sample):

```
{
    totalImages: 1000,
    formats: {
        jpg: 23,
        png: 300,
        svg: 677
    },
    biggestPicture: 'https://res.cloudinary.com/dbnuvqzms/image/upload/v1580932194/wallhdpic_20_fsou0u.jpg',
    smallestPicutre: 'https://res.cloudinary.com/dbnuvqzms/image/upload/v1580932187/wallhdpic_1_gwkxuu.jpg',
    avgSize: 3002
}

```

### Get a csv

Sample URL: SOME_URL/cloudinary/csv

Returns a CSV file with a list of All images hosted in Cloudinary (sample):

```
